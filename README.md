# Personal Portfolio Website

## Purpose
The purpose of this portfolio is to serve as a professional yet personal platform where I can showcase my background, skills, and projects in the field of Information Systems. It acts as both a dynamic résumé and an interactive space to present my work in project management, systems development, and technical documentation. Designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and visually engaging, this portfolio reflects not only my technical capabilities but also my commitment to clarity, organization, and meaningful digital design.

## Technologies Used
This personal portfolio was built with the following technologies:

- **React** – The primary JavaScript library used to create the interactive elements of the site.
- **Vite** – A modern build tool for faster React development.
- **CSS** – For styling the layout and design.

## Features and Functionality
- **Fully Responsive Design**: My portfolio is built with a mobile-first approach, utilizing modern CSS to ensure it looks professional and functions perfectly on all devices, from large desktops to tablets and mobile phones.
- **Interactive Portfolio Gallery**: The "Selected Writings" section features a clean, grid-based layout. Clicking on any project opens it in a lightbox gallery (powered by GLightbox), allowing visitors to view my work without leaving the page. Each gallery item includes a project title, a detailed description, and a custom-styled link to view the live project.
- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation**: The header navigation uses smooth scrolling to elegantly guide users between the different sections of the page, creating a seamless and pleasant user experience. The active navigation link correctly highlights based on the user's scroll position.
- **Dynamic UI Elements**: The site includes subtle but effective animations and transitions, such as:
    - A fade-in loading animation when the site first loads.
    - Smooth hover effects on buttons, links, and portfolio items.
    - A "Back to Top" button that appears when scrolling down the page.
- **Custom SVG Icons**: The social links in the footer use custom SVG icons for a sharp, high-quality look that is consistent with the site's overall design aesthetic.
